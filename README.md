# IP Address Information Swift

The aim of this repo is to demonstrate my core skills as an iOS developer with these simple apps.

In this project are 2 apps and 1 Swift package. The Swift package uses an API from https://ipapi.co/ to display IP address information, this package will be used in both of the apps one of which is written in Swift and the other in SwiftUI.

The Skills i am hoping to display any potential employers are:

- Core skills in Swift
- Core skills in SwiftUI
- Writing libraries and packages to be used in multiple projects
- Writing reusable, testable, and maintainable code

This is currently in progress and i am writing this inbetween looking for a new position.
